TPS54140A
SLVSB55C – MAY 2012 – REVISED OCTOBER 2015

TPS54140A 1.5-A, 42-V Step-Down DC/DC Converter with Eco-mode™
1 Features	3	Description

• 3.5V to 42V Input Voltage Range
• 200-m? High-Side MOSFET
• -40°C to +125°C Temperature range

The TPS54140A device is a 42-V, 1.5-A, step-down regulator with an integrated high-side MOSFET. Current-mode control provides simple external

• High Efficiency at Light Loads with a Pulse	compensation and flexible component selection. A Skipping Eco-mode™	low ripple-pulse skip mode reduces the no-load,

• Tighter Enable Threshold than TPS54140 for More Accurate UVLO Voltage
• Adjustable UVLO Voltage and Hysteresis
• 116-?A Operating Quiescent Current
• 1.3-?A Shutdown Current

regulated output supply current to 116 ?A. Using the enable pin, shutdown supply current is reduced to 1.3 ?A.
Undervoltage lockout is internally set at 2.5 V, but can be increased using the enable pin. The output voltage startup ramp is controlled by the slow start

• 100-kHz to 2.5-MHz Switching Frequency	pin	that	can	also	be	configured	for

• Synchronizes to External Clock
• Adjustable Slow Start/Sequencing
• UV and OV Power Good Output
• 0.8-V Internal Voltage Reference

sequencing/tracking. An open drain power good signal indicates the output is within 94% to 107% of its nominal voltage.
A wide switching frequency range allows efficiency and external component size to be optimized.
