The AD7091R-5 is a 12-bit, multichannel, ultra low power, succes- sive approximation analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The AD7091R-5 operates from a single 2.7 V to 5.25 V power supply and typically consumes only 24 µA at a 3 V supply in fast mode.
The AD7091R-5 provides a 2-wire serial interface compatible with I2C interfaces. The conversion process can be controlled by a sample mode via the CONVST/GPO1 pin, an autocycle mode selected through software control, or a command mode in which conversions occur across I2C write operations.
The device contains a wide bandwidth track-and-hold amplifier that can handle input frequencies up to 1.5 MHz. The AD7091R-5 also features an on-chip conversion clock, an on-chip accurate
2.5 V reference, and a programmable out of bounds user alert function.

The AD7091R-5 offers four single-ended analog input channels with a channel sequencer that allows a preprogrammed selection of channels to be converted sequentially.
The AD7091R-5 uses advanced design techniques to achieve ultra low power dissipation without compromising performance. It also features flexible power management options. An on-chip configuration register allows the user to set up different operating conditions. These include power management, alert functionality, busy indication, channel sequencing, and general-purpose output pins. The MUXOUT and ADCIN pins allow signal conditioning of the multiplexer output before acquisition by the ADC.
