solution for 256-position adjustment applications. These devices perform the same electronic adjustment function as mechanical potentiometers or variable resistors, with enhanced resolution, solid-state reliability, and superior low temperature coefficient performance. The AD5165’s supply voltage requirement is 2.7 V to 5.5 V, but its logic voltage requirement is 1.8 V to VDD. The AD5165 consumes very low quiescent power during standby mode and is ideal for battery-operated applications.
Wiper settings are controlled through a simple 3-wire interface. The interface is similar to the SPI® digital interface except for the inverted chip-select function that minimizes logic power con- sumption in the idling state. The resistance between the wiper and either endpoint of the fixed resistor varies linearly with respect to the digital code transferred into the wiper register.
