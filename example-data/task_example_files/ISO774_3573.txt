Description
The ISO774x devices are high-performance, quad- channel digital isolators with 5000 VRMS (DW package) and 3000 VRMS (DBQ package) isolation ratings per UL 1577. This family includes devices with reinforced insulation ratings according to VDE, CSA, TUV and CQC. The ISO7741B device is designed for applications that require basic insulation ratings only.
The ISO774x devices provide high electromagnetic immunity and low emissions at low power consumption, while isolating CMOS or LVCMOS digital I/Os. Each isolation channel has a logic input and output buffer separated by a double capacitive silicon dioxide (SiO2) insulation barrier. These devices come with enable pins which can be used to put the respective outputs in high impedance for multi-master driving applications and to reduce power consumption. The ISO7740 device has all four channels in the same direction, the ISO7741 device has three forward and one reverse-direction channels, and the ISO7742 device has two forward and two reverse-direction channels. If the input power or signal is lost, default output  is high for devices without suffix F and low for devices with suffix F. See the Device Functional Modes section for further details.
