GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The AD5161 provides a compact 3 mm ª 4.9 mm packaged solution for 256-position adjustment applications. These devices perform the same electronic adjustment function as mechanical potentiometers or variable resistors, with enhanced resolution, solid-state reliability, and superior low temperature coefficient performance.
The wiper settings are controllable through a pin selectable SPI or I2C compatible digital interface, which can also be used to read back the wiper register content. When the SPI mode is used, the device can be daisy-chained (SDO to SDI), allowing several parts to share the same control lines. In the I2C mode, address pin AD0 can be used to place up to two devices on the same bus. In this same mode, command bits are available to reset the wiper position to midscale or to shut down the device into a state of zero power consumption.
Operating from a 2.7 V to 5.5 V power supply and consuming less than 5 ?A allows for usage in portable battery-operated applications.
