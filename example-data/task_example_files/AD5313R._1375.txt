GENERAL DESCRIPTION


The AD5313R, a member of the nanoDAC® family, is a low power, dual, 10-bit buffered voltage output digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The device includes a 2.5 V, 2 ppm/°C internal reference (enabled by default) and a gain select pin giving a full-scale output of 2.5 V (gain = 1) or 5 V (gain = 2). The AD5313R operates from a single 2.7 V to 5.5 V supply, is guaranteed monotonic by design, and exhibits less than 0.1% FSR gain error and 1.5 mV offset error performance. The device is available in a 3 mm ª
3 mm LFCSP package and a TSSOP package.
The AD5313R also incorporates a power-on reset circuit and a RSTSEL pin that ensures that the DAC outputs power up to zero scale or midscale and remain there until a valid write occurs. The part contains a per channel power-down feature that reduces the current consumption of the device to 4 ?A at 3 V while in power-down mode.
The AD5313R employs a versatile serial peripheral interface (SPI) that operates at clock rates up to 50 MHz, and the device contains a VLOGIC pin that is intended for 1.8 V/3 V/5 V logic.
