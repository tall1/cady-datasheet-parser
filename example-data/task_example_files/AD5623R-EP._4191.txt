GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The AD5623R-EP, a member of the nanoDAC® family, is a low power, dual 12-bit buffered voltage output digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that operates from a single 4.5 V to 5.5 V supply and is guaranteed monotonic by design.

The AD5623R-EP has an on-chip 2.5 V reference giving a maximum full-scale output of 5 V. The on-chip reference is off at power-up, allowing the use of an external reference.
The AD5623R-EP incorporates a power-on reset circuit that ensures that the output of the DACs powers up to 0 V and remains there until a valid write takes place. The AD5623R-EP contains a power-down feature that reduces the current consumption of the device to 0.48 ?A at 5 V and provides software-selectable output loads while in power-down mode.
The low power consumption of this device in normal operation makes it ideally suited to portable, battery-operated equipment.
The AD5623R-EP uses a versatile, 3-wire serial interface that operates at clock rates of up to 50 MHz, and is compatible with standard SPI, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and DSP interface standards. The on-chip precision output amplifier enables rail- to-rail output swing to be achieved. Additional application and technical information can be found in the AD5623R data sheet.
