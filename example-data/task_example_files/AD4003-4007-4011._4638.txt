GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The AD4003/AD4007/AD4011 are high accuracy, high speed, low power, 18-bit, Easy Drive, precision successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The high throughput allows both accurate capture of high frequency signals and decimation to achieve higher SNR, while also reducing antialiasing filter challenges.
Easy Drive features reduce signal chain complexity and power consumption, and enable higher channel density. The reduced input current, particularly in high-Z mode, coupled with a long signal acquisition phase, eliminates the need for a dedicated high power, high speed ADC driver, which broadens the range of low power precision amplifiers that can drive these ADCs directly (see Figure 2). The input span compression feature enables the ADC driver amplifier and the ADC to operate off common supply rails without the need for a negative supply while preserving the full ADC code range. The input overvoltage clamp protects the ADC inputs against overvoltages, minimizes disturbance on the reference pin, and eliminates the need for external protection diodes.
The low serial peripheral interface (SPI) clock rate (75 MHz for the AD4003 in turbo mode) reduces the digital input/output power consumption, broadens processor options, and simplifies the task of sending data across digital isolation.
The SPI-compatible versatile serial interface features seven different programmable modes with an optional busy indicator. Using  the SDI input, several ADCs can be daisy-chained on a single
3-wire bus. The AD4003/AD4007/AD4011 are compatible with
1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3 V, and 5 V logic, using the separate supply, VIO.
