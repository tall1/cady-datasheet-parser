Description
The TPSM84209 power module is an easy-to-use integrated power supply that combines a 2.5-A DC/DC converter with a shielded inductor and passives into a low-profile QFN package. This total power solution allows as few as four external components while maintaining an ability to adjust key parameters to meet specific design requirements.
The wide input voltage range and small package size of the TPSM84209 makes the device an excellent fit for power rails that require up to 2.5 A of output current.
The QFN package is easy to solder to a printed circuit board and has excellent power dissipation capability. The TPSM84209 offers flexibility with many features and is ideal for powering a wide range of devices and systems.
