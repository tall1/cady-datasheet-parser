The TPS65919-Q1 PMIC integrates four configurable step-down converters with up to 3.5 A of output current to power the processor core, memory, I/O, and preregulation of LDOs The device is AEC-Q100 qualified. The step-down converters are synchronized to an internal 2.2-MHz clock to improve EMC performance of the device. The GPIO_3 pin allows the step-down converters to synchronize to an external clock, allowing multiple devices to synchronize to the same clock which improves system-level EMC performance. The device also contains four LDOs to power low-current or low-noise domains.
