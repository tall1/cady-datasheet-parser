Description
The LM61460-Q1 is an automotive-focused, high-performance, DC-DC synchronous step-down converter. With integrated high-side and low-side MOSFETs, up to 6 A of output current is delivered over a wide input range of 3.0 V to 36 V; tolerant of 42 V, easing input surge protection design. The LM61460-Q1 implements soft recovery from dropout eliminating overshoot on the output.
The LM61460-Q1 is specifically designed for minimal EMI. The device incorporates pseudo-random spread spectrum, adjustable SW node rise time, low-EMI VQFN-HR package featuring low switch node ringing, and optimized pinout for ease of use. The switching frequency can be set or synchronized between
200 kHz and 2.2 MHz to avoid noise sensitive frequency bands. In addition the frequency can be selected for improved efficiency at low operating frequency or smaller solution size at high operating frequency.
Auto-mode enables frequency foldback when operating at light loads, allowing an unloaded current consumption of only 7 µA (typical) and high light load efficiency. Seamless transition between PWM and PFM modes, along with very low MOSFET ON resistances and an external bias input, ensures exceptional efficiency across the entire load range.
