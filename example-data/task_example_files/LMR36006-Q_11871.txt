3 Description
The LMR36006-Q1 regulator is an easy-to-use, synchronous, step-down DC/DC converter. With integrated high-side and low-side power MOSFETs, up to 0.6 A of output current is delivered over a wide input voltage range of 4.2V to 60V. Tolerance goes up to 66 V.
The LMR36006-Q1 uses peak-current-mode control to provide optimal efficiency and output voltage accuracy. Advanced high speed circuitry allows the LMR36006-Q1 to regulate from an input of 20 V to an output of 5 V at a fixed frequency of 2.1 MHz. Precision enable gives flexibility by enabling a direct connection to the wide input voltage or precise control over device start-up and shutdown. The power-good flag, with built-in filtering and delay, offers a true indication of system status eliminating the requirement for an external supervisor.
The LMR36006-Q1 is in a HotRod™ package which enables low EMI, higher efficiency, and the smallest package to die ratio. The device requires few external components and has a pinout designed  for simple PCB layout. The small solution size and feature set of the LMR36006-Q1 are designed to simplify implementation for a wide range of end equipment.
