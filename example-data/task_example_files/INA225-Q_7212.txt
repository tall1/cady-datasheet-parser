Description
The INA225-Q1 is a voltage-output, current-sense amplifier that senses drops across current-sensing resistors at common-mode voltages that vary from 0 V to 36 V, independent of the supply voltage. The device is a bidirectional, current-shunt monitor that allows an external reference to be used to measure current flowing in both directions across a current- sensing resistor.
Four discrete gain levels are selectable using the two gain-select terminals (GS0 and GS1) to program gains of 25 V/V, 50 V/V, 100 V/V, and 200 V/V. The low-offset, zero-drift architecture and precision gain values enable current-sensing with maximum drops across the shunt as low as 10 mV of full-scale, while maintaining very high accuracy measurements over the entire operating temperature range.
The device operates from a single 2.7V to 36V power supply, drawing a maximum of 350   ?A of supply current. The device is specified over the extended operating temperature range of –40 °C to
+125 °C, and is offered in a VSSOP-8 package.
