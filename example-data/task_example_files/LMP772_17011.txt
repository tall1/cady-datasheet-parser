LMP7721
SNOSAW6E – JANUARY 2008 – REVISED DECEMBER 2014

LMP7721 3-Femtoampere Input Bias Current Precision Amplifier
1 Features	3	Description

• Unless Otherwise Noted, Typical Values at TA = 25°C, VS = 5 V.

The LMP7721 is the industry’s lowest specified input bias current precision amplifier. The ultra-low input

• Input Bias Current (VCM = 1 V)

bias current is 3 fA, with a specified limit of ±20 fA at
25°C and ±900 fA at 85°C. This is achieved with the

– Maximum at 25°C ±20 fA	latest patent-pending technology of input bias current

– Maximum at 85°C ±900 fA
• Offset Voltage ±26 µV

cancellation amplifier circuitry. This technology also maintains the ultra-low input bias current over the entire input common-mode voltage range of the

accurate signal conditioning. With these specifications, the LMP7721 has the performance to excel in a wide variety of applications such as

• Ion Chamber Amplifier	electrochemical cell amplifiers and sensor interface

• Electrometer Amplifier

circuits.

• pH Electrode Amplifier	The LMP7721 is offered in an 8-pin SOIC package
