GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The AD4003/AD4007/AD4011 are high accuracy, high speed, low power, 18-bit, Easy Drive, precision successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The high throughput allows both accurate capture of high frequency signals and decimation to achieve higher SNR, while also reducing antialiasing filter challenges.
Easy Drive features reduce signal chain complexity and power consumption, and enable higher channel density. The reduced input current, particularly in high-Z mode, coupled with a long signal acquisition phase, eliminates the need for a dedicated high power, high speed ADC driver, which broadens the range of low power precision amplifiers that can drive these ADCs directly (see Figure 2). The input span compression feature enables the ADC driver amplifier and the ADC to operate off common supply rails without the need for a negative supply while preserving the full ADC code range. The input overvoltage clamp protects the ADC inputs against overvoltages, minimizes disturbance on the reference pin, and eliminates the need for external protection diodes.
The low serial peripheral interface (SPI) clock rate (75 MHz for the AD4003 in turbo mode) reduces the digital input/output power consumption, broadens processor options, and simplifies the task of sending data across digital isolation.
The SPI-compatible versatile serial interface features seven different programmable modes with an optional busy indicator. Using  the SDI input, several ADCs can be daisy-chained on a single
3-wire bus. The AD4003/AD4007/AD4011 are compatible with
1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3 V, and 5 V logic, using the separate supply, VIO.

The AD5122A/AD5142A potentiometers provide a nonvolatile solution for 128-/256-position adjustment applications, offering guaranteed low resistor tolerance errors of �8% and up to �6 mA current density in the Ax, Bx, and Wx pins.
The low resistor tolerance and low nominal temperature coefficient simplify open-loop applications as well as applications requiring tolerance matching.
The linear gain setting mode allows independent programming of the resistance between the digital potentiometer terminals, through RAW and RWB the string resistors, allowing very accurate resistor matching.
The high bandwidth and low total harmonic distortion (THD) ensure optimal performance for ac signals, making it suitable for filter design.
The low wiper resistance of only 40 ? at the ends of the resistor array allows for pin-to-pin connection.
The wiper values can be set through an I2C-compatible digital interface that is also used to read back the wiper register and EEPROM contents.
The AD5122A/AD5142A are available in a compact, 16-lead, 3 mm � 3 mm LFCSP and a 16-lead TSSOP. The parts are
guaranteed to operate over the extended industrial temperature range of -40�C to +125�C.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The AD5161 provides a compact 3 mm � 4.9 mm packaged solution for 256-position adjustment applications. These devices perform the same electronic adjustment function as mechanical potentiometers or variable resistors, with enhanced resolution, solid-state reliability, and superior low temperature coefficient performance.
The wiper settings are controllable through a pin selectable SPI or I2C compatible digital interface, which can also be used to read back the wiper register content. When the SPI mode is used, the device can be daisy-chained (SDO to SDI), allowing several parts to share the same control lines. In the I2C mode, address pin AD0 can be used to place up to two devices on the same bus. In this same mode, command bits are available to reset the wiper position to midscale or to shut down the device into a state of zero power consumption.

The AD5165�s supply voltage requirement is 2.7 V to 5.5 V, but its logic voltage requirement is 1.8 V to VDD. The AD5165 consumes very low quiescent power during standby mode and is ideal for battery-operated applications.
Wiper settings are controlled through a simple 3-wire interface. The interface is similar to the SPI� digital interface except for the inverted chip-select function that minimizes logic power con- sumption in the idling state. The resistance between the wiper and either endpoint of the fixed resistor varies linearly with respect to the digital code transferred into the wiper register.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The AD7791 is a low power, complete analog front end for low frequency measurement applications. It contains a low noise 24-bit ?-? ADC with one differential input that can be buffered or unbuffered.
The device operates from an internal clock. Therefore, the user does not have to supply a clock source to the device. The output data rate from the part is software programmable and can be varied from 9.5 Hz to 120 Hz, with the rms noise equal to
1.1 ?V at the lower update rate. The internal clock frequency can be divided by a factor of 2, 4, or 8, which leads to a reduc- tion in the current consumption. The update rate, cutoff fre- frequency, and settling time will scale with the clock frequency.
The part operates with a power supply from 2.5 V to 5.25 V. When operating from a 3 V supply, the power dissipation for the part is 225 ?W maximum. It is housed in a 10-lead MSOP.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The AD8132 is a low cost differential or single-ended input to differential output amplifier with resistor set gain. The AD8132 is a major advancement over op amps for driving differential input ADCs or for driving signals over long lines. The AD8132 has a unique internal feedback feature that provides output gain and phase matching balanced to ?68 dB at 10 MHz, suppressing harmonics and reducing radiated EMI.
Manufactured using the next-generation of Analog Devices, Inc., XFCB bipolar process, the AD8132 has a ?3 dB bandwidth of 350 MHz and delivers a differential signal with ?99 dBc SFDR at 5 MHz, despite its low cost. The AD8132 eliminates the need for a transformer with high performance ADCs, preserving the low frequency and dc information. The common-mode level of the differential output is adjustable by applying a voltage on the VOCM pin, easily level shifting the input signals for driving single- supply ADCs. Fast overload recovery preserves sampling accuracy.

The feedback network can be adjusted to boost the high frequency components of the signal. The AD8132 is used for either analog or digital video signals or for other high speed data trans- mission. The AD8132 is capable of driving either a Category 3 or Category 5 twisted pair or coaxial cable with minimal line attenuation. The AD8132 has considerable cost and performance improvements over discrete line driver solutions.
Differential signal processing reduces the effects of ground noise that plagues ground-referenced systems. The AD8132 can be used for differential signal processing (gain and filtering) throughout a signal chain, easily simplifying the conversion between differential and single-ended components.
The AD8132W is the automotive grade version, qualified for 125�C operation per the AEC-Q100. See the Automotive Products section for more details.
The AD8132 is available in both 8-lead SOIC and 8-lead MSOP packages for operation over the extended industrial temperature range of -40�C to +125�C.

Description
The INA225-Q1 is a voltage-output, current-sense amplifier that senses drops across current-sensing resistors at common-mode voltages that vary from 0 V to 36 V, independent of the supply voltage. The device is a bidirectional, current-shunt monitor that allows an external reference to be used to measure current flowing in both directions across a current- sensing resistor.
Four discrete gain levels are selectable using the two gain-select terminals (GS0 and GS1) to program gains of 25 V/V, 50 V/V, 100 V/V, and 200 V/V. The low-offset, zero-drift architecture and precision gain values enable current-sensing with maximum drops across the shunt as low as 10 mV of full-scale, while maintaining very high accuracy measurements over the entire operating temperature range.
The device operates from a single 2.7V to 36V power supply, drawing a maximum of 350   ?A of supply current. The device is specified over the extended operating temperature range of �40 �C to
+125 �C, and is offered in a VSSOP-8 package.

Description
The LM61460-Q1 is an automotive-focused, high-performance, DC-DC synchronous step-down converter. With integrated high-side and low-side MOSFETs, up to 6 A of output current is delivered over a wide input range of 3.0 V to 36 V; tolerant of 42 V, easing input surge protection design. The LM61460-Q1 implements soft recovery from dropout eliminating overshoot on the output.
The LM61460-Q1 is specifically designed for minimal EMI. The device incorporates pseudo-random spread spectrum, adjustable SW node rise time, low-EMI VQFN-HR package featuring low switch node ringing, and optimized pinout for ease of use. The switching frequency can be set or synchronized between

DESCRIPTION
The LMK04000 family of precision clock conditioners provides low-noise jitter cleaning, clock multiplication and distribution without the need for high-performance voltage controlled crystal oscillators (VCXO) module. Using a cascaded PLLatinum� architecture combined with an external crystal and varactor diode, the LMK04000 family provides sub-200 femtosecond (fs) root mean square (RMS) jitter performance.
The cascaded architecture consists of two high-performance phase-locked loops (PLL), a low-noise crystal oscillator circuit, and a high-performance voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The first PLL (PLL1) provides a low- noise jitter cleaner function while the second PLL (PLL2) performs the clock generation. PLL1 can be configured to either work with an external VCXO module or use the integrated crystal oscillator with an external crystal and a varactor diode. When used with a very narrow loop bandwidth, PLL1 uses the superior close-in phase noise (offsets below 50 kHz) of the VCXO module or the crystal to clean the input clock. The output of PLL1 is used as the clean input reference to PLL2 where it locks the integrated VCO. The loop bandwidth of PLL2 can be optimized to clean the far-out phase noise (offsets above 50 kHz) where the integrated VCO outperforms the VCXO module or crystal used in PLL1.
The LMK04000 family features dual redundant inputs, five differential outputs, and an optional default-clock upon power up. The input block is equipped with loss of signal detection and automatic or manual selection of the reference clock. Each clock output consists of a programmable divider, a phase synchronization circuit, a programmable delay, and an LVDS, LVPECL, or LVCMOS output buffer. The default startup clock is available on CLKout2 and it can be used to provide an initial clock for the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or microcontroller that programs the jitter cleaner during the system power up sequence.

Typical Application Circuit

The TPS6040x-Q1 family of devices generate an unregulated negative output voltage from an input voltage ranging from 1.8 V to 5.25 V. The devices are typically supplied by a preregulated supply rail of 5 V or 3.3 V. Due to its wide-input voltage range, two or three NiCd, NiMH, or alkaline battery cells, as well as one Li-Ion cell, can also power them.
Only three external 1-?F capacitors are required to build a complete DC-DC charge pump inverter. Assembled in a 5-pin SOT-23 package, the complete converter can be built on a 50-mm2 board area. Replacing the Schottky diode typically needed for start-up into load with integrated circuitry can achieve additional board area and component count reduction.
The TPS6040x-Q1 can deliver a maximum output current of 60 mA, with a typical conversion efficiency of greater than 90% over a wide output current range. Three device options TPS60401/2/3-Q1 with 20-kHz, 50-kHz, and 250-kHz fixed frequency operation are available. TPS60400-Q1 device comes with a variable switching frequency to reduce operating current in applications with a wide load range and enables the design with low-value capacitors.

Description
The TPS6214x family is an easy-to-use synchronous step-down DC-DC converter optimized for applications with high power density. A high switching frequency of typically 2.5 MHz allows the use of small inductors and provides fast transient response by use of the DCS-Control� topology.
With their wide operating input voltage range of 3 V to 17 V, the devices are ideally suited for systems powered from either a Li-Ion or other batteries, as well as from 12-V intermediate power rails. It supports up to 2 A of continuous output current at output voltages between 0.9 V and 6 V (with 100% duty-cycle mode). The output voltage start-up ramp is controlled by the soft-start pin, which allows operation as either a standalone power supply or in tracking configurations. Power sequencing is also possible by configuring the Enable (EN) and open-drain Power Good (PG) pins.
In Power Save Mode, the devices draw quiescent current of about 17 ?A from VIN. Power Save Mode, entered automatically and seamlessly if the load is small, maintains high efficiency over the entire load range. In Shutdown Mode, the device is turned off and current consumption is less than 2 ?A.
The device, available in adjustable and fixed output voltage versions, is packaged in a 16-pin VQFN package measuring 3 mm � 3 mm (RGT).

3 Description
The TPS65320D-Q1 device is a combination of a high-VIN DC-DC step-down converter, referred to as the buck regulator, with an adjustable switch-mode frequency from 100-kHz to 2.5-MHz, and a high-VIN 280-mA low-dropout (LDO) regulator. The input range is 3.6 V to 36 V for the buck regulator, and 3 V to
36 V for the LDO regulator. The buck regulator has an integrated high-side MOSFET. The LDO regulator features a low-input supply current of 45-?A typical in no-load, also has an integrated MOSFET with an active-low, push-pull reset output pin. The input supply of the LDO regulator auto-source from the output of the buck regulator when it is in operation. Low-voltage tracking feature enables TPS65320D-Q1 to track the input supply during cold-crank conditions.
The buck regulator provides a flexible design to fit system needs. The external loop compensation circuit allows for optimization of the converter response for the appropriate operating conditions. A low-ripple pulse-skip mode reduces the no-load input-supply current to maximum 140 ?A.
The device has built-in protection features such as soft start, current-limit, thermal sensing and shutdown due to excessive power dissipation. Furthermore, the device has an internal undervoltage-lockout (UVLO) function that turns off the device when the supply voltage is too low.
